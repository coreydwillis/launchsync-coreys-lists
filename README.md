Head over to [@wizzomafizzo](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo)'s [LaunchSync ReadMe](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/mrext/blob/main/docs/launchsync.md#sync-files) for instructions on how to use these sync files.

Once you have the LaunchSync installed, download one of the sync files from this repo and run the LaunchSync script.
